# The Construct Way: How We Use Data To Drive Insights.

You've probably seen us talking a great deal about how our data analytics services can help you, but you may not know that we use our own services as well! On a regular basis, our analytics team brainstorms and experiments on Construct’s data, and if it works well, we bring it to our clients.

Today, we will cover how we turned parts of Google Analytics data into actionable market intelligence for our internal marketing team.

## What is Google Analytics?

Google Analytics, known in the industry as GA, is a free “service that provides statistics and basic analytical tools for search engine optimisation and marketing purposes” (source). There is a wealth of information within GA; with tabs that lead into menus that lead into sub-menus, this can feel overwhelming.

Since we deal mostly with customer analytics, we get most of our data from the “Audience” and “Behaviour” tabs. Using this data, we can help our clients identify and segment their customers, figure out where their leads come from, and build propensity models based on behaviour (among many other things).

For this internal campaign, we wanted to explore mobile device data in particular, so we analysed data from the Audience -> Mobile menu.
